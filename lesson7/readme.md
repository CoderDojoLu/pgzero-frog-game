# Lesson 7

- Added water background
- Play jumping sound
- Play losing sound
- Play winning sound
- Added background music

- Tweaked the last visible lilypad size to show for a full second instead
  of some random value. Trying to prevent lose state being unpredictable.

Problems:
- Jump sound lags behind, seems to be a potential pygame mixer buffering issue.
