# Lesson 4

- Create a Pond object to draw the lilypads.
- Create a pygame scaling function to scale the size of images.
- Move the frog to lilypad positions.

Problems:
- Notice the frog moves to much, because we can only poll for keydown states.
  In the next lesson, we will work around this issue, by not moving until
  after the keydown state is cleared.
