![Game Clip](docs/images/game_clip.gif?raw=true)

## Objective
This is a short tutorial on building up a simple game using Pygame Zero. It
was presented at the [DFW Pythoneers Sept 12, 2015 meetup](http://www.meetup.com/dfwpython/events/222577053/).

See PyGame Zero documentation for installation instructions:

## Game Description
The objective of this game is to move the Frog to the safety of a rock by
using a grid of disappearing lilypads. This is an even simpler version of
the Russian game [Perestroika (Toppler)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perestroika_(video_game)).
